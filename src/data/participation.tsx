Afterwards, I managed to view a game of soccer played by robots both inside and outside of the event hall, quite an interesting sight to see in today’s modern age.\n\nDay 3 | 5th April (Operations Team)\nBehind the stage, I assisted with the trophy sortation and presentation during the awards ceremony. I sorted out all the trophies according to category and age group and brought them to the front table to be displayed and sorted.\n\nI assisted with the keying of data for the slides used during the ceremony. As the latest results for the winning teams were being updated, I was tasked with updating the slides accurately and efficiently so they could be ready on time for the ceremony. Afterwards, I was tasked to help sort out the trophies based off category and age group, and display them in the front so it could be easily given to the teams, it was a tedious and tiring duty but my team completed it swiftly and precisely for a smooth prize presentation ceremony.",
