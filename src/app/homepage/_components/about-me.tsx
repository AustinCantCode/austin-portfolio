      <p>
        Currently a third year student at Singapore Polytechnic pursing a
        diploma in Information Technology, specializing in User Experience and
        Interface (UI/UX) design. As of 2025, I am serving an internship at
        Amber Creative Singapore to further educate myself on the latest web
        development technologies and to better myself as a full-stack software
        developer.
